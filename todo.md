  - i want to be able to sort these by popularity, release date, and rating
- add a way to search for new movies from like oscar winners / stuff like that
- add a way to show you recommendations based on the movies you have upvoted and downvoted, not sure if this is possible with the tmdb api but it would be really cool
- search bar for looking through people when adding a recommended movie
- add jackson rating system that works like belli for rating movies where you say whether you liked that movie first then whether you liked it more or less than another movie and it does that till it finds the exact ranking of that movie in your list, then it can use that to calculate your user score and give you better recommendations
